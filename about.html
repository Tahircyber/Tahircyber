            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>Hey there! I'm <strong>Tahir</strong>, but you might know me by my alias <strong style="color: #6A0DAD;">@ydkmt</strong> – a name I carry along my cyber adventures, as you’ll see on the <a href="index.html">Home</a> page.</p>
            <p>I’m a passionate and determined individual breaking into the exciting world of cybersecurity. Although I’m relatively new to the field, I’m diving in headfirst, eager to learn, and sharpen my skills in ethical hacking, vulnerability assessments, and security analysis.</p>
            <p>Through this portfolio, I aim to not only document my journey but also showcase my growing expertise and problem-solving abilities. I hope that it will help me stand out and provide me with that edge in this competitive industry.</p>
            <p>Cybersecurity isn’t just a career path for me; it's a calling. I’m motivated to contribute to a safer digital world by identifying and addressing security flaws that others may overlook. My journey has only just begun, and I’m excited to keep pushing my limits.</p>
            <p>Currently based in Manchester, I’m constantly looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. Thanks for taking the time to explore my work!</p>
